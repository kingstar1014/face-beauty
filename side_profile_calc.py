2) correct malocclusion if that is causing your angle to be overly obtuse. You especially want to address any hyper/hypo divergent growth patterns, where your jaw can become too elongated or short.

To improve your facial convexity, we want to try and improve the balance in projection of your facial thirds. This is primarily done through altering the position of the upper jaw (maxilla) and lower jaw (mandible). 

Consulting an orthodontist or maxillofacial surgeon is the best bet as the course of action would depend on the severity of your case. Some options are:

1) Orthognathic surgery to forcibly alter the position of your upper/lower jaw to be in better alignment. This is more financially costly and invasive. This would be appropriate in cases of severe malocclusion.

2) braces may be the only thing needed to align your jaw.

3) other orthodontic contraptions can set your teeth in proper alignment.

Along with correcting any malocclusion (reference facial convexity glabella), there are a few ways to improve your nasomental angle. The best course of action would depend on the specifics of your case:

1) Chin implants if your angle is too acute can help increase the angle and boost harmony. Keep in mind this would have to consider other facial assessments as the change does not occur in isolation.

2) Rhinplasty to alter your nose shape in a specific way to either increase or reduce this angle. One such example would be reducing your nasal projection, which tends to increase the angle and vice versa. 

Generally, this angle is the same conceptually as the nasofacial, but the angles vary inversely."""
