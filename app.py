To improve your facial convexity, we want to try and improve the balance in projection of your facial thirds. This is primarily done through altering the position of the upper jaw (maxilla) and lower jaw (mandible). 

Consulting an orthodontist or maxillofacial surgeon is the best bet as the course of action would depend on the severity of your case. Some options are:

1) Orthognathic surgery to forcibly alter the position of your upper/lower jaw to be in better alignment. This is more financially costly and invasive. This would be appropriate in cases of severe malocclusion.

2) braces may be the only thing needed to align your jaw.

3) other orthodontic contraptions can set your teeth in proper alignment.

4) facial hair around the chin can improve perceived chin projection, which can increase this angle into the harmonious range.

Again, these are suggestions and giving a precise course of action would require consulting a specialist and taking X-rays."""

Along with correcting any malocclusion (reference facial convexity glabella), there are a few ways to improve your nasofacial angle. The best course of action would depend on the specifics of your case:

1) Chin implants if your angle is too obtuse can help reduce the angle and boost harmony. Keep in mind this would have to consider other facial assessments as the change does not occur in isolation.

2) Rhinplasty to alter your nose shape in a specific way to either increase or reduce this angle. One such example would be reducing your nasal projection, which tends to reduce the angle and vice versa."""

Along with correcting any malocclusion (reference facial convexity glabella), there are a few ways to improve your nasomental angle. The best course of action would depend on the specifics of your case:

1) Chin implants if your angle is too acute can help increase the angle and boost harmony. Keep in mind this would have to consider other facial assessments as the change does not occur in isolation.

2) Rhinplasty to alter your nose shape in a specific way to either increase or reduce this angle. One such example would be reducing your nasal projection, which tends to increase the angle and vice versa.

There are a few ways to improve the shape of your frontal bone, or forehead:

1) custom forehead implants to make your forehead flatter in shape if it is too sloped back. Achieving drastic results may not be that realistic. 

2) using a hairstyle that covers your forehead to distract from or hide this specific feature.

3) custom forehead implants localized near the brow region to increase the slant of your forehead if it is too flat. This would also have to consider other assessments like the nasofrontal angle and facial convexity."""

There are a few ways to alter FWHR, but it is largely unchangeable due to it being linked heavily to one's bone structure:

1) gaining or losing facial- fat can either increase or reduce your FWHR, respectively. 

2) Cheekbone implants can increase facial width, thereby increasing FWHR slightly.

3) upper lip filler can reduce the vertical distance of your midface, thereby increasing FWHR slightly. 

4) lowering the brow position is not really surgically possible or advised, but if you can grow eyebrow hair more interior towards your nose, that can increase FWHR.

Reducing FWHR is not as possible aside from losing facial fat and invasive zygomatic remodeling (cheekbone reduction surgery).

There are a few ways to improve the contour of your jaw:

1) losing facial-fat can reveal your jaw contour better, often resulting in a more pleasant angle.

2) Custom jaw implants to specifically design your jaw's desired shape.

3) fixing malocclusion in the same way that it would address your MPA. Your JFA is heavily tied to your MPA.

4) Chin implants -- a wider chin tends to reduce this angle, while a narrower chin increased it. Facial hair can also conceptually do this to some degree.

5) Masseter reduction surgery. An overly wide jaw can tend to increase this angle. Conversely, increasing your jaw width through chewing exercises can increase this angle if yours is on the lower end.

3) Hairstyles can manipulate the perceived dimensions of your face similar to the facial thirds. If your face is overly long, a wider hairstyle may help and vice versa.

Altering your forehead width will mostly have to do with altering your hairline. While altering this proportion is generally not necessary unless it is an extreme case, there are a few ways to do so:

3) using a hairstyle to cover your forehead

4) altering your hair length. For example, wider bitemporal widths may suit shorter sides, while narrow foreheads may suit longer hairstyles.

While extremely difficult to change the actual underlying morphology of your eyes, there are a few ways to improve this assessment:

1) lose body-fat to create a thinner face, thereby increasing your ESR and making your eyes appear wider set. The opposite also holds true -- if you have overly wide set eyes, gaining some weight on your face can lead to the appearance of more normally spaced eyes.

2) hairstyles to alter your perceived facial width. Along the same lines as facial fat, you can play around with hairstyles that add width to your face or reduce it. For example, if you have extremely wide set eyes, longer hairstyles that cover the sides of your face or add width can improve your perceived facial harmony. If your eyes are closer set, shorter hairstyles with shorter sides may suit your face better.

3) Cheekbone implants to increase the width of your face. Or, zygomatic reduction surgery to do the opposite. 

Overall, the only thing you can do is alter your facial width, but not the actual spacing of your eyes themselves.
